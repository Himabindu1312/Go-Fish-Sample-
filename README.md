## Go Fish Card Game Simulation in Python

## Description:
This Python program simulates the classic card game "Go Fish" between two players using stacks and queues. The game involves drawing cards from a central deck to collect sets of matching cards. Each player's hand is represented by a stack, while the central deck is represented by a queue. Players take turns asking each other for specific cards to match with cards they already have. If the opponent has the requested card, it is given to the asking player; otherwise, they "Go Fish" and draw a card from the central deck. The game continues until all the cards are used up. The player with the most sets of matching cards at the end wins.
